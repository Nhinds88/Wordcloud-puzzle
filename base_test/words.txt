Hello my name is Nick.
This is test text for a wordcloud puzzle I am trying to build out.
Hopefully I can figure this out.. hahaha
Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.
Through Passion, I gain Strength.
Through Strength, I gain Power.
Through Power, I gain Victory.
Through Victory my chains are Broken.
The Force shall free me.
